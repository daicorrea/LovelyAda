                            <li>Ada Lovelace's real name was Augusta Ada King-Noel. She was the Countess of Lovelace and that's why she turned into "Ada Lovelace".</li>
                            <li>She was born in 10 December 1815 </li>
                            <li>Her father was the famous poet George, Lord Byron. However, when Ada was one month old, her father left Ada and her mother. He never saw her again. </li>
                            <li>Ada's mom, Anne Isabella Milbanke ("Annabella"), loved math and wanted to prevent Ada to follow her father's steps with poetry. So she hired a lot of tutors with Math and science sckills to promote Ada's interest. </li>
                            <li>Ada was still interested in her father and was asked to be buried beside him.</li>

                            <li>When Ada was 12 she decided she wanted to fly. She thought a lot and put together a lot of materials. In 1828 she decided to create a wing so she studied the anatomy of birds to determine the right proportion between the wings and the body.</li>
                            <li>She documented all her findings in an illustrated guide she called "Flyology" but then her mother started reprimanding her for neglecting her studies so she had to stop.</li>
                            <li>In 1833 Ada was making her d√©but at the age of seventeen in a flamboyant party when she met Babbage, an inventor who was talking a lot about the "Difference Machine", an invention that could calculate just jurning a handle.</li>
                            <li>Babbage and Ada turned into great friends exchanging a lot of letters and knowledge, One inspiring the other. </li>
