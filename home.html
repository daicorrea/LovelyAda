                            <li>Ada Lovelace's real name was Augusta Ada King-Noel. She was the Countess of Lovelace and that's why she turned into &quot;Ada Lovelace&quot;.</li>
                            <li>She was born in 10 December 1815 </li>
                            <li>Her father was the famous poet George, Lord Byron. However, when Ada was one month old, her father left Ada and her mother. He never saw her again. </li>
                            <li>Ada's mom, Anne Isabella Milbanke (&quot;Annabella&quot;), loved math and wanted to prevent Ada to follow her father's steps with poetry. So she hired a lot of tutors with Math and science sckills to promote Ada's interest. </li>
                            <li>Ada was still interested in her father and was asked to be buried beside him.</li>

                            <li>When Ada was 12 she decided she wanted to fly. She thought a lot and put together a lot of materials. In 1828 she decided to create a wing so she studied the anatomy of birds to determine the right proportion between the wings and the body.</li>
                            <li>She documented all her findings in an illustrated guide she called &quot;Flyology&quot; but then her mother started reprimanding her for neglecting her studies so she had to stop.</li>
                            <li>In 1833 Ada was making her debut at the age of seventeen in a flamboyant party when she met Charles Babbage, an inventor who was talking a lot about the &quot;Difference Machine&quot;, an invention that could calculate just jurning a handle.</li>
                            <li>Babbage and Ada turned into great friends exchanging a lot of letters and knowledge, one inspiring the other. </li>

                            <li>In 1840, Babbage gave a seminar in the University of Turin about his Analytical Engine. The lecture was written in French and Ada translated it to English.</li>
                            <li>While she was translating, she was making a lot of notes that were later on published in Taylor's Scientific Memoirs under the initialism AAL.</li>
                            <li>Her notes were labelled alphabetically from A to G and in the last one she made an algorithm for Babbage's Analytical Engine to use Bernoulli numbers. This was the first algorithm that could be implemented into a computer so it was considered the first computer program.</li>
                            <li>The Analytical Engine was never completed so unfortunally her algorithm was never tested. </li>

             <p>Ada Lovelace died in November 1852, with 36 years from uterine cancer. While some even tried to argue that Babbage was the true mind behind all the discoveries, Ada was the real one to find out the poetic of his machine. For her so called &quot;poetical science&quot;, she could see the true potential of the invention and for that, Babbage called her &quot;Lady Fairy&quot;.</p>
